    "Ans:- Multiprocessing in Python is a technique that allows a system to support more than one processor at the same time. It refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple processes simultaneously, thereby improving the performance of the system. In a multiprocessing system, applications are divided into smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to different processors, enabling parallel execution and efficient utilization of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiprocessing module in Python provides a simple and intuitive API for dividing work between multiple processes. It allows you to create programs that can run concurrently, bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and utilizing the full potential of your CPU cores. Each process created by the multiprocessing module has its own Python interpreter and Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This means that each process can execute Python code independently without being affected by the GIL, resulting in improved performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful in scenarios where you need to perform computationally intensive tasks or parallelize your code to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. By distributing the workload across multiple processes, you can achieve faster execution times and better resource utilization."

    "Ans:- In Python, multithreading and multiprocessing are two techniques used to achieve parallelism and concurrency, respectively.\n",
    "A process is a program that has been loaded into memory along with all the resources it needs to operate. It has its own memory space. A thread is the unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads running as a part of it, where each thread uses the processâ€™s memory space and shares it with other threads .\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads are spawned by a process to do different tasks, at about the same time, just one after the other. This gives you the illusion that the threads are running in parallel, but they are actually run in a concurrent manner. In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents the threads from running simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing, on the other hand, is a technique where parallelism in its truest form is achieved. Multiple processes are run across multiple CPU cores, which do not share the resources among them. Each process can have many threads running in its own memory space. In Python, each process has its own instance of Python interpreter doing the job of executing the instructions."
